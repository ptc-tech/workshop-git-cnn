# This is a sample GitLab CI/CD configuration file that should run without any modifications.
# It demonstrates a basic 3 stage CI/CD pipeline. Instead of real tests or scripts,
# it uses echo commands to simulate the pipeline execution.
#
# A pipeline is composed of independent jobs that run scripts, grouped into stages.
# Stages run in sequential order, but jobs within stages run in parallel.
#
# For more information, see: https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/README.html#stages

stages:          # List of stages for jobs, and their order of execution
  - test
  - cml_run
  - deploy

# Pip's cache doesn't store the python packages

# If you want to also cache the installed packages, you have to install

  stage: deploy  # It only runs when *both* jobs in the test stage complete successfully.
